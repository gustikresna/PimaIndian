The dataset is from The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Its main goal is to help in determining if a patient is diabetic, using various measures. This data was collected from the Pima Indian community in Phoenix, Arizona, USA who has been the focus of research due to their high susceptibility to diabetes.

- Blood Pressure     : Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

- Insulin            : Insulin concentration (μ U/ml) at 2 hours in an OGTT
- BMI                : Body mass index (weight in kg)/(height in m)2
- Diabetes Pedigree  : The genetic influence of the subject’s relatives with condition of both affected and unaffected to diabetes
